These notes are 1) a work in progress 2) thrown up here while the event is going on so participants can find them.

Conclusions made here are often shooting from the hip, and not as definitive as they sound. Expect mistakes, find them, let me know where I went wrong. I'm sharing this information to help people learn...help me learn as well.

More things will be added over the comming weeks, and the research already here will continue to be perfected. Keep watching. Following @ISeeDeadPackets for announcements.
